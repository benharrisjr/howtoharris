      <h3>Our Favorite Diaper Change Products</h3>
      <a href="https://www.costco.com/huggies-plus-diapers-sizes-1---6.product.100152047.html">
        <h4>Diapers</h4>
      </a>
      <p style="margin-top: 8px;">Noelle is what I call a diaper snob.  We tried almost every kind of diaper there was when Noelle was born.  The only diaper she was happy in was Huggies.  They can be pretty pricey but if you get them at <a href="https://www.costco.com/huggies-plus-diapers-sizes-1---6.product.100152047.html">Costco</a>, a membership will actually pay for itself!  I pay 31 cents a diaper for size 5 at Costco but Newborn is only 21 cents!! Not to mention the fact that they also have sales sometimes AND they have their own Kirkland brand which are decent.  I definitely still prefer Huggies but they are good.  Plus you can order them online with free delivery! </p>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/30NEsvM">
          <h4>Diaper Cream</h4>
      </a>
      <p style="margin-top: 8px;">If you use something like <a href="https://amzn.to/30NEsvM">A&D</a> for every diaper change, chances are you won't need the heavy duty stuff as often.  The squeeze tubes can be a fortune.  I liked to buy the big tub from either Amazon or Costco. If you sign up for subscribe and save you even get a further discount!  I always made sure to have some <a href="https://amzn.to/3kcr2CG" >Destin</a> or something similar on hand in case she did get diaper rash which did happen a few times a year.  </p>
      <a href="https://amzn.to/2DmaE1F"><h4>Wipes</h4></a>
      <p style="margin-top: 8px;">My favorite wipes are the <a href="https://amzn.to/2DmaE1F">Huggies 99% water wipes</a> which Costco used to sell! I still get them at my local grocery store once in a while when they are on sale but I started primarily using the <a href="https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-baby-wipes-900-count.product.11489346.html">Costco brand 99% water wipes</a> and I'm pretty happy with them.  When I was pregnant I remember hearing all about the water wipes and I thought I'd want to use them but not only are the a FORTUNE but I actually didn't even like them as much as the huggies or kirkland brand (that's the name of Costco's store brand).  </p>

        </a>  
            <p style="margin-top: 8px;">I originally ordered these because I thought they'd be a great prop for our food stand tiktok's but Noelle has learned so much from this toy!! She has learned how to use velcro, how to match two things together, and even how to cut! It comes with a very dull fake knife that you use to cut the pieces of food and she mastered it within 2 days!  I think it's really teaching her how to cut food safely, maybe she will be able to help prep dinner soon!
