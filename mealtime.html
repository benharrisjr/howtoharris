    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Bamboo Plates</h3>
  </a>
  <p style="margin-top: 8px;">We used to use those plates with the 3 different sections but I noticed Noelle was starting to make sure each food item remained in it's separate space and it's complicated to ensure food stays separate as an adult so I wanted to get her used to regular plates with no dividers.  I decided to get these because I am trying to eliminate plastic from our life for a number of reasons.  I thought they were really cute, and they're not nearly as dangerous or breakable as most other plate materials such as ceramic or glass.  She really loves her 'big girl plates' as I call them and I plan on getting matching bowls and cups since I am so happy with them so far. </p>

      </a>
      <p style="margin-top: 8px;">Noelle was using those soft baby spoons for a while but they made it very difficult for her to feed herself and she always wanted to try ours which were way too big for her mouth.  I got her these forks because they look like real silverware but are the perfect size for a toddler! I got the spoons too and will probably try the knives when I think she's ready.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Dr. Brown's Straw Sippy Cups</h3>
  </a>
  <p style="margin-top: 8px;">We introduced these straw sippy cups when Noelle was about 10 months old.  She didn't really get the hang of it until she was almost 1.  She was completely off the bottle by 1 and I think these sippy cups had a lot to do with that.  She was breast fed and bottle fed with Dr. Browns bottles and I think these were an easy transition from those bottles.</p>

      </a>
      <p style="margin-top: 8px;">Noelle's dentist told us that the goal is to get her drinking from regular open top cups as soon as possible.  We introduced these 360 sippy cups when she was about 1.  Sometimes she loves them, and other times she won't drink from them.  We still give her milk and water in the straw sippy cup that she likes (see Dr. Brown's above) but we try to offer these or even a regular open cup as often as possible.  I'm hoping to get her off of the straw cups soon!</p>

    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Dr. Brown's Options Bottles</h3>
  </a>
  <p style="margin-top: 8px;">My plan was to exclusively breast feed.  When Noelle was born she was in the NICU for 5 days and I had a very hard time getting her to latch becuase they wouldn't let me even try until she was 3 days old which I am still upset about.  I ended up breastfeeding, pumping, and formula feeding which was so emotional and exhausting that I can't even explain it.  We had tried a dozen different bottles but my lactation consultant recommended Dr. Brown's because she said they can help the baby open their mouth wider and get better at breast feeding.  We liked the bottles a lot and they did help slightly.  The options ones are the best because you can use them with or without the colic system which we never really needed.  There are a ton of different designs available! </p>
