        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Melissa and Doug Cleaning Set</h3>
      </a>
      <p style="margin-top: 8px;">Noelle loves to pretend she's cleaning the house!  I like it too becuase I think it's helping her develop some real life skills.  She likes to help with the real broom too, but these are much easier to manage and a lot more fun for her!</p>

          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">If you're here from TikTok, here's my mousepad!</h3>
        </a>
        <p style="margin-top: 8px;">I searched for a cute mousepad for over a year and I finally found one! I was tired of looking at the photo of a bank on the mousepad I had gotten for free during college.  It spruced up my desk and makes me smile!</p>

          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Velcro Food!</h3>
        </a>  
            <p style="margin-top: 8px;">I originally ordered these because I thought they'd be a great prop for our food stand tiktok's but Noelle has learned so much from this toy!! She has learned how to use velcro, how to match two things together, and even how to cut! It comes with a very dull fake knife that you use to cut the pieces of food and she mastered it within 2 days!  I think it's really teaching her how to cut food safely, maybe she will be able to help prep dinner soon!
